Minimalist Rust syntax parsing for procedural macros.

You can think of `myn` as a minimalist crate with similarities to [`syn`](https://docs.rs/syn). It provides utilities to help write procedural macros, but does not attempt to replicate the `syn` types or API.

`myn` exists to support a very small subset of the entire Rust language syntax. Just enough to implement `#[derive]` macros on `struct`s and `enum`s, and that's about it. Everything else is currently out of scope.

## Why

- 100% safe Rust ðŸ¦€.
- Write `#[derive]` macros with extremely fast compile times. See [benchmarks](./benchmark.md).

## MSRV Policy

The Minimum Supported Rust Version for `myn` will always be made available in the [MSRV.md](./MSRV.md) file on GitHub.
